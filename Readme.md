## 🧠 About Me

I’m a highly motivated and self-taught developer with a deep interest in solving real-world problems using technology. My focus lies in building scalable web applications, working with modern frontend frameworks, and using Python to power intelligent systems.I have recently enrolled in the power learn project which is a 16 week software engineering program. I also have interest in the evolving world of AI and believe that AI is a tool for helping programmers to come up with new and better systems that will help in solving alot of problems that we have in education, healthcare, agriculture and so on

- 🔭 Currently working on **EXAECHO** — a CBC-aligned platform that generates smart past papers for learners.
